The following functionality will be added soon:

Code cleanup
    The code needs to be cleaned up and made more efficient.

killperprocessname directive
    Will accept a boolean value. If true, only 1 process per process scope will ever be
    killed, instead of all process IDs matching kill rules.  This should be used in conjunc-
    tion with the new killcmd directive. For example, you may define that a database daemon
    may never take up more than 90% CPU time, and it runs many children processes. If it
    exceeds 90% CPU time, you want to issue ONE restart command in order to stop and then
    start all the database processes in one go.

time period limited rules
    Functionality to limit validity of process scopes to only be checked between defined time
    periods. For example, only check that httpd is running between the hours of 8am and 5pm on
    Mondays and Tuesdays.
