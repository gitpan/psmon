	* psmon (1.58), psmon.html (1.4): First commit to try and get
	cmndline =~ regex checking based process scope rules. This is
	currently only working to respawn dead process, and does not yet
	know how to describe what it is restarting when logging and
	notifying.

	* psmon (1.55): Mar 24 17:53:21 nicolaw psmon[11657]: Removing stale
	PID file.  Mar 24 17:53:21 nicolaw psmon[11657]: Forking background
	daemon, process 11658.	Mar 24 17:53:21 nicolaw psmon[11658]: Forking
	second background daemon, process 11659.  Mar 24 17:53:21 nicolaw
	psmon[11659]: Terminating.
	
	This bug was reported by Jordan Lederman <jlederma@advance.net> on
	Mon 24 Mar 2003.  Daemon spawned psmon instances seem to die
	immediatelty after forking for the second time. The while PID file
	exists loop was checking against the old $O{pidfile} variable
	container which is now moved to a locally scoped lexical withing
	the main look and daemonize function.

	* psmon (1.54), psmon.html (1.2, rel-1-0-4): Interim commit to fix
	a --daemon spawn bug

2003-03-20 16:21  tag rel-1-0-3

2003-03-20 16:21  nicolaw

	* README (1.1, rel-1-0-4), psmon.1 (1.1, rel-1-0-4), psmon.html
	(1.1) (utags: rel-1-0-3): Updating refreshed documentation

2003-03-20 16:14  nicolaw

	* psmon (1.53, rel-1-0-3): Added the KillCmd directive to kill
	processes using a user defined command insted of or in addition to
	just sending a regular SIGKILL signal to the process.
	
	Moved the printing of sysvinit style statuses to a seperate
	subroutine which decides what to print and when to surpress output.
	
	Changed the way that dryruns are detected at spawn and kill time so
	that only one set of log and status messages have to be maintained.

2003-03-20 13:37  nicolaw

	* psmon (1.52): Added the NeverKillPID and NeverKillProcessName
	directives.

2003-03-20 12:56  nicolaw

	* psmon (1.51): Got rid of the following global variables in to the
	%O hash:    $PIDFILE, $DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE, $CONFIG_FILE, $DAEMON, 
	$CRON, $DRYRUN, $USER, $ADMINEMAIL

2003-03-19 17:22  tag rel-1-0-2

2003-03-19 17:22  nicolaw

	* psmon (1.50, rel-1-0-2): Fixed major bug whereby the --user
	option code somehow appeared to be complete rubbish, and therefore
	would have either always scanned all or none of the process table
	instead of just those processes owned by the specified user. This
	is now fixed and will be tested shortly.
	
	Moved the killing and spawning actions out in to two seperate
	subroutines that are called by the main check_processtable()
	routine.  This makes the code slightly easier to read, and will
	make adding the new killcmd and related commands slightly easier to
	insert.
	
	Added validation for the lastsafepid configuration directive to
	ensure it's value is always numeric.
	
	Changed the loglevel of reporting of saving protected PIDs from
	death from INFO to whatever the defined loglevel for that process
	is. If there is none defined then the default loglevel will be
	applied.

	the last commit!

2003-03-17 13:44  nicolaw

	* psmon (1.48): Added isnumeric() function to cope with potentially
	non-numeric output from config and process table scan when numeric
	is expected. In response to bug reported by Andy Brown
	<andybrown21@hotmail.com>

2003-03-04 16:32  nicolaw

	* psmon (1.41): Updated sendmail() I think

2003-03-03 14:12  nicolaw

	* psmon (1.40): Changed the syslog code so that the inital testing
	and daemonizing uses syslog with PERROR so that erorrs get logged
	to the connected terminal too. Once it's been daemonized or started
	to do an actual process check, it reopens the syslog connection
	without PERROR so that log entries only end up in syslog.

2003-02-28 17:53  nicolaw

	* psmon (1.39), psmon.conf (1.15, rel-1-0-0): LOG_CRIT or worse
	errors no longer cause a die from log().  All orrurances of
	LOG_CRIT logging which relied on this fucntionality have been
	changed to manually force an exit with a unit exit return value.

2003-02-28 17:18  nicolaw

	* psmon (1.38): Added support to change the syslog facility logged
	to, and set different loglevels for different kill and spawn
	actions.

	in to sprintf was the problem - fixed

2003-02-12 18:44  nicolaw

	* psmon (1.34): Changes %.2f to %s for the moment - much
	strangeness when tested on mdk

2003-02-12 18:40  nicolaw

	* psmon (1.33): Fixed some formatting and $slay hash reference
	syntax errors

2003-02-12 18:27  nicolaw

	* psmon (1.32): I think I have fixed the safe PIDFile code which
	protects named parent processes. The code was accidentally only
	implemeneted for one slaying critera (oops). This needs to be
	tested though.
	
	Also added support for additional description of why each process
	was actually slayed,.. including some figures.

2003-02-12 15:49  nicolaw

	* psmon (1.31): Now uses $PIDFILE to support config file
	indepentant PID files to allow many psmon instances using different
	configs to run as daemons

2003-02-12 15:08  nicolaw

	* psmon (1.30): $PIDFILE is added - need to change the code to use
